# Bike share

## Introduction
Used to organized and analysis bike share system
using pandas and NumPy for three major cities in
the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Project Overview:
 Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles
 on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows
 people to borrow a bike from point A and return
 it at point B, though they can also return it to the
 same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
 Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

***How to Run the program***
Click on 'bikeshare_2.py' or navigate to the 'bikeshare_2.py' directory using
cd [directory] then 'python bikeshare_2.py'

***How does it work?***

The program starts taking user's inputs; city to analyze(e.g. Chicago), month
to filter with or 'all' if you don't want to filter with month, day to filter with
or 'all' if you don't want to filter with a specific day.

**What does it give us?**
  * Info about most common time
      * The most common  month
      * The most common day
      *  The most common hour
      * Time taken to calculate it

  * Info about most Popular Stations
      * The most common start station
      * The most common end station
      * The most common start and end station
      * Time taken to calculate it

  * Info about most trip duration
      * The total travel time and its count
      * The average travel time and its count
      * Time taken to calculate it

  * Info about user stats.
      * Info about user type
        Number of Subscribers, number of Customer, and # of Dependent
      - Info about gender
        Number of males and # of females.
      - Most common year Birth(if in CSV file)
      - oldest and youngest year of birth(if in CSV file)
      - Time taken to calculate it

  * Show raw data depend on user choice
